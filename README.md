**key Learning are as follow:-**  

1. Loaded Files from Excel Worksheet, Excel CSV  
Distinct v/s Unique  
Data Set : 1 2 3 3 4 4  
Distinct Value : 4  
Unique Value : 2  

2. Power Query : Transform Data are done in Power Query.  
- All trasformation data are recorded in APPLIED STEPS section like remove add column & rows etc.
- M Code : Whatever the changes made on data, those action are done by M code Language in Backend.

3. Create MasterDate Table with Date Format
- `DateMaster = CALENDAR(FIRSTDATE(Bank_Churn[Bank DOJ]), LASTDATE(Bank_Churn[Bank DOJ]))`
- `Year = YEAR(DateMaster[Date])`
- `Month = FORMAT(DateMaster[Date], "MMM")`

4. Data Modeling in Power Pivot : Dealing with the cardinality between the tables.  
Creating Relationship between the tables. Fact Tables & Dimension Tables.
- One to One Relationship & One to Many Relationship
- Star Schema : All the Dimension tables are connected to the main Fact table.
- Snowflake schema : Dimension tables may or maybe indirectly connected to the main Fact table through another Dimension table.
- Galaxy Schema or Bridge Schema : Multiple Fact tables and Dimension tables involves.

5. Created Seperate Table for Measure.  
`Total Customers = COUNT(Bank_Churn[CustomerId])`
`Active Customers = CALCULATE(COUNT(Bank_Churn[IsActiveMember]), ActiveCustomer[ActiveID]=1)`
`Inactive Customers = CALCULATE(COUNT(Bank_Churn[IsActiveMember]), ActiveCustomer[ActiveID]=0)`
`Credit Card Holders = CALCULATE(COUNT(Bank_Churn[CustomerId]), CreditCard[Category]="Credit card holder")`
`Non Credit Card Holders = CALCULATE(COUNT(Bank_Churn[CustomerId]), CreditCard[Category]="Non Credit card holder")`
`Exit Customer = CALCULATE([Total Customers], ExitCustomer[ExitCategory]="Exit")`
`Retain Customers = CALCULATE([Total Customers], ExitCustomer[ExitCategory]="Retain")`

6. Displayed all Measures in Card Visual.

7. Created Slicer to filter the Visual data by Year, Month, Location, Gender

8. Created Column for Customers with Credit Score remark.  
`Credit Type = SWITCH(TRUE(), Bank_Churn[CreditScore]>=800 && Bank_Churn[CreditScore]<=850,"Excellent",
Bank_Churn[CreditScore]>=740 && Bank_Churn[CreditScore]<=799, "Very Good",
Bank_Churn[CreditScore]>=670 && Bank_Churn[CreditScore]<=739,"Good",
Bank_Churn[CreditScore]>=580&&Bank_Churn[CreditScore]<=699,"Fair",
Bank_Churn[CreditScore]>=300&&Bank_Churn[CreditScore]<=579,"Poor")`

9. Clustered Column Chart visual.
Active & Inactive members. Year and Month Wise. With some formatting.
Note : Drill Up, Drill Down Concept.

10. Time Intelligence Functions. How to get previous months Exit customers.New Measure created.  
`Previous Month Exit Customers = CALCULATE([Exit Customer],PREVIOUSMONTH(DateMaster[Date]))`

11. Line Chart. It shows Month wise Exit Customer and Secondary Y axis as Previous month Exit Customer.

12. Donut Chart to show in percentage. Exit Customer by Gender Category.

13. Bar Chart Exit Customer by Credit Type data.
